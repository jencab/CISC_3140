I am new to databases so I chose to use Khan Academy's lessons on it. I have used Khan Academy before for other classess so I knew I would understand it clearly. From their lesson I learned the basics of working with databases.<br>
I learned how to create a database and store data in that database. Specifically, I created a table named booklist that held data of some books. <br>

I also practiced querying a database. Here I listed all movies from the year 2000 and up and ordered the list by release year.

I also learned how to use aggregae functions such as SUM on databases. <br>

After watching the videos Khan Academy provided I worked on querying a database I created through postgres SQL. <br>
