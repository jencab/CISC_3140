<b> Part 1: Connecting to BC's Web Lab Linux Server using SSH </b><br>

 Pre-Work <br>
 1.  If you donâ€™t have an SSH Client or a terminal environment to start you can download Putty, a free open-source terminal emulator. <br>
 2.  You will also need to know your credentials to be able to log in. To find this search 'linux login' in your primary email and you should find your login information in an email sent to you.<br>
 
 Connecting to the BC server
 1. Load Putty. We will only focus on the Session Logging in page, it should look like this. <br>

<b> Part 2: Some Linux Programs </b><br>
1. `curl` transfers data from or to a server. Syntax: `curl [options] [URL...]`<br>
If no option is specified curl will print the source code of the homepage of the URL inputed. <br>
These are some options curl provides.<br>
`-o` or `0` saves the result of the `curl` command <br>
`-C` resumes a download <br>
`-I` fetches only the HTTP headers of the specified resource.
