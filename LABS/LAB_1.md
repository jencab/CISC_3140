In my group, the first thing we decided on was that we wanted a project that would personally help the user. An e-waste disposal locator and a public bathroom locator were some of the ideas that were considered before we settled on our final idea, an ATM locator. We chose the ATM locator over the others because more members of the group related to the trouble of finding an ATM and this would make it easier to plan out what features we wanted.  
We discussed that our app would use an API to list ATM locations around the area and the user would be able to filter the list by certain criteria like needing a specific bank or finding an ATM with the least fees to pay. After discussing some of the features we wanted we decided we would split into smaller groups, a front end team and a back end team. These teams would have smaller sub teams as well to handle different processes. For example, we discussed that the back end sub teams needed to handle things like hosting, databases, servers, etc.  
When first discussing ideas members were very vocal on voice chat and through text although it was a little tricky when multiple members wanted to speak at the same time. Our initial 12 person group worked well when discussing ideas because everyone was able to communicate with each other and many ideas could be passed around. The initial group also worked well when broadly discussing what we needed to implement for an app like this such as using an API.
