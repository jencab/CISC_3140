The problem I chose to work on was creating a word counter.

Below is the HTML file <br>
<img src= "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70915926/114495027-60e25e80-9beb-11eb-9c0b-3e0c3abafdaf.png" width="70%"/> <br>
- Displas the word count as text
- Has a textarea for user to input text
- Links to the javascript file
<br><Br>


Below is the javascript file <br>
<img src= "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70915926/114495169-a010af80-9beb-11eb-8b77-d82209caf8e5.png" width="70%"/><br>
- var count references the id of the count
- var input references the id of the textarea
- The event listener is triggered for every input from the user
- var text holds user input with the exception of spaces in the text
- Start the word count at zero before going into the for loop
- In for loop, for every word in the textarea that is not an empty space, add one to wordCount
- var wordCount holds the total word count
- set the word count display to the the total word count
