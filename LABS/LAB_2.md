## Application: Zoom
### Zoom is a video conferencing application that allows users to meet online with or without sharing their video or camera

Task 1
> User needs to share their screen for a class presentation.
> Zoom allows users to share their screen in several different ways. The user can either share their whole screen or share one, or several, single window such as a single google chrome tab or a powerpoint presentation. There are also more advanced option offered such as sharing a virtual whiteboard, sharing only a portion of their screen, or sharing a specific file that is in a online file saver such as dropbox. <br>
To share their powerpoint presentation the user would click on the option to share their screen that is at the bottom of the zoom meeting in a taskbar. The user would then be presented with a popup that gives them several different ways to share their screen as mentioned above. The user would most likely chose to only share the window that their presentation is on as opposed to their whole screen. Once confirming their preferred way of sharing their presentation their zoom meeting would transform from the default viewing. The taskbar with move to the top of the user's screen informing them that they are sharing their screen and the window they are sharing would have it's borders highlighted in green. <br> 
> Several problems could occur and not all of them would not be the sole fault of the user. The meeting host could have created the meeting with the restriction that participants could not share their screen. The user could accidently click a different window than what they wanted.
