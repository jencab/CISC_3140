## Application: Zoom
### Zoom is a video conferencing application that allows users to meet online with or without sharing their video or audio

Task 1
> User needs to share their screen for a class presentation.
> Zoom allows users to share their screen in several different ways. The user can either share their whole screen or share one, or several, window such as a single google chrome tab or a powerpoint presentation. There are also more advanced options offered such as sharing a virtual whiteboard, sharing only a portion of their screen, or sharing a specific file that is in an online file saver such as dropbox. <br>
To share their powerpoint presentation the user would click on the option to share their screen that is at the bottom of the zoom meeting in a taskbar. The user would then be presented with a popup that gives them several different ways to share their screen as mentioned above. The user would most likely chose to only share the window that their presentation is on as opposed to their whole screen. Once confirming their preferred way of sharing their presentation their zoom meeting would transform from the default viewing. The taskbar with move to the top of the user's screen informing them that they are sharing their screen and the window they are sharing would have it's borders highlighted in green. <br> 
> Potential problems include the meeting host could have created the meeting with the restriction that participants could not share their screen. Also, the user could accidently click a different window than what they wanted. 

Task 2
> User needs to signup with an account to access a zoom meeting.
> Zoom allows for users to join meetings as a guest if the user does not want to create an account. If joining a meeting as a guest the user will be prompted to enter their name so that participants and the host will know who they are. <br> 
To sign up the user will have to confirm their birth to make sure that they are old enough to use the application. Then, the user will need to submit a valid email such as a gmail account or a university account and will have to confirm their account to be able to join meetings. The user will need to click on a link to confirm their account and they will be brought to a web page to finish creating their account. They will then need to input their name and create a password. Once they do this and confirm it their account is all set up.
> Potential problems that could occur are that the user may use an email that is linked to an existing zoom account therefore they cannot use the email to create another account. The user could also use accidentally include a typo in the email they submitted; this would send the confirmation email to a different email account and the user would not be able to finish creating their account. Another typo related issue that could happen is the user misspelling their password or including a character without realizing it. Zoom does not include the option to reveal their password so the user would not know if they wrote their password correctly.

Task 3
> User wants to share the zoom virtual whiteboard with participants.
> When clicking the option to share their screen, Zoom gives users the option to share a virtual whiteboard with participants. Both the meeting host and participants are allowed to draw on the whiteboard when it is being shared. <br>
To share a whiteboard the user must click on the share screeen option that is on the taskbar of the bottom of the Zoom screen. Once clicked on the user will be given the option to share a virtual whiteboard along with many other options. Once they begin sharing, the Zoom meeting is transformed into the whiteboard and the user is able to draw, add text, and save the content as a pdf or png.
> Potential problems the user could run into if the user is the meeting host is participants drawing or typing irrelevant content and distracting other participants with it. If the user is not the meeting host a potential problem that could arise is the host restricting participants from sharing a whiteboard or restricting participants from adding to the whiteboard.
