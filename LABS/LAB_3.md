Job Posting: [Product Designer (UI Focus)](https://www.builtinnyc.com/job/design/product-designer-ui-focus/77763)

This posting is looking for a product designer that will create an enjoyable user experience on both web and mobile platforms for multiple audiences. <br>
To prepare for this interview I would first make sure my portfolio is updated and accessible. I would add any new projects i've completed or revise any projects im not fully satisfied with. <br>
Once I update my portfolio I would familiarize myself with the software or languages that are mentioned in the job posting; in this case the posting asks for a deep understanding of Sketch, Figma, Adobe CC, and other prototpying tools; it also asks for an understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript fundamentals. Having a general understanding of all of these and a deeper understanding of the languages mentioned is one of the skills I have and can bring to this job. <br>
I would then familiarize myself with UI interaction by speaking to friends who are in the UI/UX field and gather information on what else I would need to know or what would be good to know in a job like this. I would also practice several interviews with this friend as they have knowledge on what type of questions would be asked and have more experience in the field itself.
